The projects you find here are the ones I've created to learn the basics of arduino.

These aren't meant to fix problems or anything, they're just so that I can learn the basics and make cooler stuff in the future.
Many of these projects will be made following build guides found on websites such as youtube, I will credit the creators if I used their tutorial in the readme files of each project.
