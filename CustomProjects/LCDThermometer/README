This was my first custom project being made without any tutorial.

It measures the temperature and humidity of the air and displays this information on a Liquid Crystal Display.
You can use a button to change the display from showing the temperature in celcius to farenheit and vice versa by holding it down for ~1 second.
The potentiometer is used to adjust the contrast between the screen's background and its text - somewhere in the middle is best for me.

Materials Used:
-1x Arduino UNO R3
-1x LCD1602 Module
-1x DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Module
-1x Button
-1x Potentiometer
-2x 5k1 Resistor (can be substituted for a single 10k resistor)
-A lot of breadboard jumper wires
-1x Power supply  module & 9v battery (can be ignored if powering arduino with a computer)
