BeginnerProjects are the projects I made following tutorials to help me learn arduino.

CustomProjects are projects that I thought would be challenging or interesting, and I built them on my own.
I didn't follow any tutorials, although I may have used videos or other documentation to learn how individual components worked.

Honestly - these are pretty cool!
